 * Turn "Corner of Oak Road and Example Way" into a point on a map.

 * Ported from the full app unchanged in substance, because the thing it knows is
 * expensive to relearn (see `variants` below). The coordinates still exist — a
 * map needs them — but nobody should have to *type* them. An admin setting up a
 * stop knows the street corner, not the latitude, and asking them for 37.3230 /
 * −122.0140 is how you end up with a pin in the ocean.
 *
 * Uses OpenStreetMap's Nominatim: free, no API key, no billing account. Google's
 * Geocoding API would need a card on file, which is a strange thing to ask of
 * someone trying out a bus tracker.
 *
 * Their usage policy asks for an identifying User-Agent and no more than one
 * request a second. An admin adding a stop by hand is nowhere near that, but the
 * limiter below makes it true rather than merely likely.
